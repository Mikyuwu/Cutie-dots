# Cutie-dots ðŸŒ¸
> A basic rice for a basic girl ~ Mikyu

This repository has been made to share and store my various dotfiles made for my **machine** :3

I will try to do my best to document my dots. Even though you can copy them and use them as such with a lot of work, I still think it's better to take inspiration from it!

I hope that you will like them as much as I do! <3

## How to access them ?
The dots are stored in branches to organize them! You can use the navigation thingy or click the links down below!
